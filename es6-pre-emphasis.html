                            <p> Pre-emphasis was a noise reduction technique used in early CDs. They increased the treble on a CD, and the CD player would lower the treble back down to normal levels. Almost all CD players properly de-emphasize a CD that has had pre-emphasis applied. Most computers WILL NOT do so. Most ripping software WILL NOT do so. There are even some CDs that have pre-emphasis applied that are not properly tagged as such, so the CD player will not properly de-emphasize. ##Some resources: https://wiki. Basically I want a rack with two EQ8s where, if I add gain on the first EQ, it automatically subtracts the same amount of EQ on the same frequency on the second EQ (so I can slot, for example, a saturation plugin in between which is getting the pre-emphasis EQ but the EQ isn't impacting the actual sound). Is this possible with Live's rack system. 
For those not familiar with the complete red-book audio spec, it contains a spec called de-emphasis. In an attempt to deal with tape hiss that was present on analog master tapes, as well as 14 bit DACs, some CDs were mastered with increased loudness and treble. A CD Player would "auto-magically" turn down the treble and loudness of the CD and give you the original sound will less tape hiss. Well, in this modern age of ripped CDs, online music downloads, and portable media players If you didn't see my previous post about CDs with pre-emphasis, you can see it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/59h90s/you_sit_down_and_decide_to_play_some_music_you/ Here is my step by step guide on how to de-emphasize FLACs you already have that were ripped from a CD that have pre-emphasis using Foobar2000. Things you will need to download: Foobar2000 ( Sox resampler plugin for foobar2000 (https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,67373. If you have a transceiver in an FPGA sending data over a cable and you've found the ideal pre-emphasis settings for say 25G and you change the code FPGA so the transceiver now runs at 10G, do you need different pre-emphasis settings? My suspicion is no, since the rise time is the same then the pre-emphasis settings are correcting the same high frequency components in both cases. Do you guys agree. "I have a BenQ XL2730z and I cannot fathom why I had piss poor performance when I switched from 120hz HDMI to 144hz Display Port. It was even worse than my old 60fps tv. I am a very competitive gamer and I can tell the difference in input lags and display port had the worse. There's several possible factors for why it produced input lag. 1. It's a similar factory overclock and needed more volt swing whatever that is. 2. Display port acts differently than HDMI and just doesn't push the frames. Description of Problem Infrequently (a couple times every few hours), while gaming, exactly one of my two monitors (AOC G2460PF) will turn black for 2-3 seconds, then return to normal.

I'm looking for full-blown modules like most popular DampD or Pathfinder ones, but that outline more scenarios ideal for non-combat resolution. Many d20 modules like to focus on going from point to point killing anything that is standing in your way. Sure, you can go off the rails and come up with alternate solutions, but then you end up not being able to follow the adventure as laid out in most cases. I'm looking to have a full adventure laid out for me to run for my PCs as I am short Hey everyone! I'm a very stressed senior who needs to choose the college he is going to in two days or less. I got accepted to UC Irvine for biological sciences, and I'm looking to pursue a pre-med pathway in hopes of getting into medical school. My question is: would I be better off going to a UC like UCI, or going to SDSU, where (it seems like) there's less competition, less grade deflation, and an overall better chance at standing out to med schools? I also got into UCD, and pretty Hello, amp#x200B; I have done a long internship in semiconductor circuit design, doing verification, working with layouts, schematics, timing models, running DRC, LVS, static timing analysis etc. I found out that i enjoy this verification work but NOT schematic design (like design a schematic for PLL, ADC, etc). amp#x200B; Now, in my final year, i had taken analog circuit design, cmos mixed signal circuit design, and low power digital circuit design. Overall this covered analog amplifier. I was tweaking my undervolting settings on my Vega 56 this evening. I have just installed the latest 19.1 drivers. I've been trying to resolve my undervolting reset issue for weeks. I've now just noticed that when I'm using dual screens the minimum core voltage is 1.05v, regardless of p state, and will only go higher if I up the voltage in p7 or gpu utilisation. This only occurs when I have one display port and one hdmi monitor connected. The same two monitors both using display So for some background, I’m in my second semester of sophomore year and basically about to get into the in-depth biology courses. Next semester I’m taking a 3000 level biology course, biochemistry, second round of physics. I’ve managed a 3.5 GPA so far. Not the greatest, not the worst. I can barely drag myself to lectures and the only reason I’m doing solid is because I test well and when I do study- I feel like I do it well, naturally. The problem lies in the fact that I feel like I’m 
Hi, I'm looking at going for paramedicine in university, and was talking with one of my friends who said that generally, nursing is a prerequisite or good experience for paramedicine (she's studying for a bachelor in nursing). I haven't seen anything about this, but I am able to go for a certificate in nursing before the course if required (I plan on studying in 2020, but can delay by a year if required). I'm curious to know, is this a true fact, and should I consider it or not? Note;. Hey everyone, What was your experience on Security +? Any advice for studying for it? Thanks.

So you wanna get into tapes in this day and age, but chances are you have pretty much zero idea what to do or what to look for. Speaking as someone who started with absolutely zero info and only has some inkling of what he's doing, I'm writing this to help other beginners, so that they don't make a potentially stupid decision. First off, what to buy? The best, most reliable tape players are undoubtedly the standard standalone hifi separate decks. In plain English, a regular cassette player. </p>
